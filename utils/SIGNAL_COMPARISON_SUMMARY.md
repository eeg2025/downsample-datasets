# EEG Signal Format Comparison Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the signal quality comparison between the original EEGLAB SET files and the converted EDF/BDF formats using the HBN dataset.

## Dataset Information
- **Original Dataset**: `/Users/yahya/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-pulcher88@gmail.com/My Drive/to Share/HBN Minisets/hbn_bids_R5_L100`
- **EDF Dataset**: `/Users/yahya/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-pulcher88@gmail.com/My Drive/to Share/HBN Minisets/hbn_bids_R5_edf`
- **BDF Dataset**: `/Users/yahya/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-pulcher88@gmail.com/My Drive/to Share/HBN Minisets/hbn_bids_R5_bdf`

## Analysis Results

### Files Analyzed
- **Total Files Compared**: 10 random file trios
- **Common Channels**: 129 channels per file
- **Analysis Tool**: MNE-Python with custom comparison script

### Signal Fidelity Metrics

#### SET vs EDF (16-bit precision)
- **Mean Correlation**: 1.0000 ± 0.0000
- **Median RMS Error**: 7.13e-08
- **Signal Preservation**: >99.99%

#### SET vs BDF (24-bit precision)  
- **Mean Correlation**: 1.0000 ± 0.0001
- **Median RMS Error**: 1.88e-10
- **Signal Preservation**: >99.99%

### Key Findings

1. **Excellent Signal Preservation**: Both EDF and BDF formats maintain extremely high fidelity to the original SET files with correlations effectively at 1.0.

2. **BDF Superior Precision**: BDF format shows ~380x better precision than EDF (1.88e-10 vs 7.13e-08 RMS error), confirming the expected advantage of 24-bit vs 16-bit encoding.

3. **Minimal Signal Loss**: The RMS errors are in the range of 1e-10 to 1e-07, which represents negligible signal degradation for most EEG analysis applications.

4. **Format Consistency**: All 10 randomly selected files showed consistent performance across different tasks and subjects.

## Practical Implications

### For ML Pipelines
- **EDF Format**: Suitable for most ML applications where file size is a concern
- **BDF Format**: Recommended when maximum precision is required
- **Both formats**: Maintain signal integrity sufficient for typical EEG analysis workflows

### Storage Considerations
- **EDF**: Smaller file sizes due to 16-bit encoding
- **BDF**: Larger files but with superior precision for research applications

### BIDS Compliance
Both converted datasets are now fully BIDS-compliant with:
- ✅ Complete metadata files (dataset_description.json, participants.tsv, etc.)
- ✅ Task-level configuration files
- ✅ Subject-level event files
- ✅ Code and derivatives directories
- ✅ Proper file naming conventions

## Generated Outputs

### Analysis Files
- `comparison_results.json`: Detailed numerical results
- `summary_comparison.png`: Overview plots comparing all metrics

### Individual File Plots (10 files × 3 plots each = 30 plots)
For each file trio:
- **Signal Comparison**: Overlay plots of SET, EDF, and BDF signals
- **Signal Differences**: Difference plots showing SET-EDF and SET-BDF
- **Correlations**: Channel-wise correlation heatmaps

## Conclusion

The conversion from EEGLAB SET to EDF/BDF formats using the emgio package has been highly successful:

1. **Signal integrity is preserved** with minimal loss across both formats
2. **BDF format provides superior precision** as expected from 24-bit encoding
3. **Both formats are suitable for ML pipelines** with proper indexing capabilities
4. **Datasets are now BIDS-compliant** and ready for analysis workflows

The converted datasets successfully address the original indexing problems with SET files while maintaining excellent signal fidelity, making them ideal for machine learning pipeline integration.
